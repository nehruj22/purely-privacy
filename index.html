We collect only city-level location for matching purposes:

• Your profile shows only your city and state/province (e.g., "Toronto, ON")

How Location Works:
1. Your device provides location data
2. We convert coordinates to city name only
3. Only the city name is shown on your profile
4. Precise coordinates are processed temporarily to calculate distance and are not stored or shared with other users
